WHY?
-------------------------------
You have a git repository living someplace in the "cloud". This repository has accumulated a lot of branches over time. Those branches have stuff that you don't want to lose while moving to a different git hosting service. This gem allows you to easily move from one git host to another. 

If you're reading this and thinking "Why not scp the directory to the new server?", then you should go do that. This tool was written for when that is not an option.

HOW?
-------------------------------
git clone git@github.com:nerded/anserine.git
git remote add new_host git@evilhub.com:nerded/anserine.git
anserine migrate origin new_host
